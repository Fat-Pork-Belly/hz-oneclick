What is HZ-OneClick?

HZ-OneClick is a modular delivery platform for provisioning and operating a hybrid stack across:
	•	Oracle Cloud (OCI) VPS instances
	•	Homelab nodes and edge servers

The project is organized as modules so you can compose “presets” for different targets (Lite / Standard / Hub) without rewriting everything.
